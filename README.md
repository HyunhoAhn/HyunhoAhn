# Hi, I'm Hyunho (Francis) Ahn 👋
**AI/ML Engineer** | M.S. from The Ohio State University

*Specializing in optimization and deployment of LLMs/CNNs on distributed & edge systems.*

### 🚀 Core Competencies
I go beyond running benchmarks- I architect solutions to uncover the "why" behind performance.
* **Proven Excellence:** Achieved the **highest performance review score** for 2 consecutive years at **AMD** (Intern).
* **Scalable Deployment:** Built containerized benchmarking environments (Docker, TensorFlow) for distributed & edge systems.
* **Full-Stack Optimization:** Expert in model quantization (ONNX, QDQ) and system-level bottleneck analysis.
* **Research:** Published in top journals (**IEEE TII**, Top 1.8% JCR).

### 📊 RyzenAI Performance Logs
Documenting experiments and performance insights on **Ryzen AI 395+ (128GB RAM)**.

🤝 Special thanks to AMD & Framework for sponsoring the hardware (Ryzen AI 395+ Desktop) for this benchmarking project.

* *[Coming Soon] Benchmarking setup and initial baselines...*

### 🛠 Technical Stack
* **Languages:** Python, C/C++, CUDA, Assembly (ARM), SQL
* **AI & Inference:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, TFLite, OpenVINO, QNN
* **Tools & DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, Git, MLPerf
