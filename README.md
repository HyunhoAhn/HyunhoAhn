# Hi, I'm Hyunho (Francis) Ahn 👋

I am an **AI/ML Engineer** specializing in the optimization and deployment of LLMs and CNNs on distributed systems and edge devices. 

With a Master’s in Computer Science & Engineering from The Ohio State University, I bridge the gap between complex model architectures and hardware acceleration.

### 🚀 What Sets Me Apart
I don't just run benchmarks; I architect solutions that reveal the "why" behind performance metrics.
* **Proven Excellence:** I consistently deliver top-tier results, achieving the **highest performance review score** for two consecutive years as an AI Performance Engineer Intern at AMD.
* **Scalable Deployment:** I developed containerized inference environments using Docker and TensorFlow, facilitating efficient performance benchmarking across distributed systems and edge devices.
* **Full-Stack Optimization:** My expertise spans from high-level model quantization (ONNX Runtime, QDQ) down to system-level bottleneck analysis.
* **Research-Backed Engineering:** I bring rigorous academic discipline to engineering, having published in top journals (IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Top 1.8% JCR).


### 📊 RyzenAI Performance Logs
I am currently documenting my experiments and performance measurements on **Ryzen AI 395+ with 128GB RAM**. I treat this repository as a technical blog to share raw insights and optimization techniques.

🤝 Special thanks to AMD & Framework for sponsoring the hardware (Ryzen AI 395+ Desktop) for this benchmarking project.

* *Coming Soon: Benchmarking setup and initial baselines...*
* *LINK SOON*
